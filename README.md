# AI Engineering Bootcamp Batch 1 at Jakarta Labs 

Date: 3 April 2022 - present

This is my repository for learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intellignece at AI Engineer Bootcamp. I include the materials of the bootcamp and additional exercises from external resources.

The bootcamp learning materials are in the folder **AI-Engineering-Bootcamp** which also available [here](https://github.com/ramadnsyh/AI-Engineering-Course). However, in structuring the folders, I do not exactly follow the order / nomenclature that is in the sylabus, but rather manage it based on my personal convenient. 

This repository contains materials about:
1. Python for Scientific Computing (Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib)
2. Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised)
3. (TO BE UPDATED)



If you have something in mind to discuss, feel free to contact me. 

Thank you and have a nice day.
